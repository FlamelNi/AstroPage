# My Morning Routine

They say how you start your morning sets the tone for the entire day. After years of experimentation, I've developed a morning routine that helps me feel energized, focused, and ready to tackle whatever comes my way.

## The Early Hours

I wake up at **6:00 AM**, before the rest of the world gets noisy. There's something magical about those quiet morning hours when everything feels possible. Here's how I spend them:

### 6:00 - 6:15 AM: Gentle Wake-Up

- No snooze button (this was hard to learn!)
- Open the curtains to let natural light in
- Drink a full glass of water
- Do some light stretching

### 6:15 - 6:45 AM: Movement

Whether it's a quick jog, yoga session, or just a walk around the block, getting my body moving early makes a huge difference. Exercise releases endorphins and helps clear the mental fog from sleep.

### 6:45 - 7:15 AM: Mindfulness

This is my time for *intentional thinking*. I alternate between:

1. Meditation (using a simple breathing technique)
2. Journaling (stream of consciousness writing)
3. Reading (usually non-fiction or something inspiring)

## The Power of Consistency

The key isn't perfection—it's consistency. Even on days when I can't do the full routine, I try to hit at least one or two elements. Over time, these small habits compound into significant changes.

## Tips for Building Your Own Routine

- **Start small** - Don't try to change everything at once
- **Prepare the night before** - Lay out clothes, prep breakfast
- **Track your progress** - A simple habit tracker works wonders
- **Be patient** - It takes about 66 days to form a habit
