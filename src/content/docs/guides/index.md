Welcome to the Guides section. Here you'll find task-focused documentation that helps you accomplish specific goals.

## What Are Guides?

Guides are practical, goal-oriented documentation. Unlike tutorials that teach concepts step-by-step, guides assume you have some familiarity with the project and want to accomplish a specific task.

### Guides vs. Tutorials

| Guides | Tutorials |
|--------|-----------|
| Task-focused | Learning-focused |
| "How do I deploy?" | "Let's learn about deployment" |
| Concise and direct | Detailed explanations |
| Reference when needed | Follow start to finish |

## Contributing Guides

Have a task that should be documented? Guides are a great way to share knowledge with others. Each guide should:

1. Focus on a single, specific task
2. Provide clear, actionable steps
3. Include code examples where helpful
4. Link to related documentation
